Key Sections Explained
User Context
Captures communication preferences, technical level, and any specific requirements mentioned during conversation
Technical Decisions
Documents why certain approaches were chosen over others, preventing future agents from undoing intentional choices
Code Examples
Includes actual code snippets for complex implementations, ensuring the next agent understands the implementation style
Important Warnings
Highlights any critical information that could cause issues if not known (e.g., "Don't modify X because it will break Y")
Related Files
Lists all files that were created or modified, with brief descriptions of their purpose and changes
Notes for the Next Agent
